# Argument Graph Adaptation

This application requires an [nlp service](https://github.com/recap-utr/nlp-service), so set it up first.
When using OpenAI services, obtain an API key and put it in `openai_api_key.txt`.
Then, we recommend to use docker to start this app.

```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The evaluation client as well as the corresponding dataset are available at our [`arguelauncher`](github.com/recap-utr/arguelauncher) repository.
