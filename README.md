# ArgueGen: Case-Based Argument Graph Adaptation

This application requires an [nlp service](https://github.com/recap-utr/nlp-service), so set it up first.
The evaluation client as well as the corresponding dataset are available at our [`arguelauncher`](github.com/recap-utr/arguelauncher) repository.
You can start the service with nix:

```shell
nix develop -c poetry run python -m arguegen
```
