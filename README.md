# ReCAP Argument Graph Adaptation

## Installation

TODO

## Folder Structure

Within the folder `data`, there are two folders: `input` and `output`.

## Input Folder

For each case that should be adapted, create a folder with an arbitrary name in `input`.
Then, place the following files in that folder:

-   `benchmark.csv`
-   `benchmark.json`
-   `case.csv`
-   `case.json`
-   `query.txt`

## Output Folder

You only need to create the folder `output`.
It will then be used by the application to store the adapted cases.
For each run, you will get a folder that is named based on the current date and time.
You are free to delete adapted cases that are not needed anymore.
